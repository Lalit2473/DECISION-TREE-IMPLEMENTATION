üìò Overview
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow‚Äîfrom data exploration and model building to deployment‚Äîusing the Decision Tree Classifier on the popular Iris dataset. The project also includes a lightweight Flask web application that allows users to predict the species of iris flowers based on input features.

By combining scikit-learn, matplotlib, and Flask, this project offers both educational value and a hands-on demonstration of deploying ML models in real-world applications.

üìä Dataset Description
The Iris dataset is a classical dataset used in pattern recognition and machine learning. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:

sepal length (cm)

sepal width (cm)

petal length (cm)

petal width (cm)

Each sample is labeled as one of three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

‚úÖ Project Steps
1. Data Loading and Exploration
We begin by importing the Iris dataset using sklearn.datasets.load_iris. Basic exploration such as printing feature and target names gives us insights into what the model will be learning and predicting.

python
Copy
Edit
print("Features:", iris.feature_names)
print("Target classes:", iris.target_names)
This confirms our 4 numerical features and 3 target classes.

2. Data Splitting
To evaluate the model's performance fairly, we split the dataset using train_test_split:

python
Copy
Edit
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
This uses 70% for training and 30% for testing, ensuring reproducibility with random_state=42.

3. Model Training with Decision Tree
We initialize and train a Decision Tree Classifier with the entropy criterion (Information Gain) for better interpretability.

python
Copy
Edit
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
4. Evaluation
After training, predictions are made and evaluated using classification_report and accuracy_score. In our case, the model achieves nearly 98% accuracy on unseen test data:

Classification Report:
               precision    recall  f1-score   support
        0       1.00      1.00      1.00        19
        1       0.93      1.00      0.96        13
        2       1.00      0.92      0.96        13
Accuracy Score: 0.98
5. Visualization
We visualize the trained decision tree using plot_tree() from sklearn.tree. This helps interpret the decision logic:

python
Copy
Edit
plt.figure(figsize=(24, 12))
plot_tree(clf, feature_names=iris.feature_names, class_names=iris.target_names, filled=True)
plt.show()
A textual representation of the tree is also generated with export_text().

üåê Web Application with Flask
To make the model accessible, we built a simple Flask web application that:

Accepts 4 feature inputs from the user

Predicts the Iris species using the trained model

Displays results with styled HTML & CSS

Features:
Clean, responsive form

Error handling for invalid inputs

Clear output of predicted species

How it Works:
The Jupyter Notebook is converted to a .py script using nbconvert

The notebook code is executed once on server start, loading the model and dataset into memory

User inputs are taken through an HTML form and used to predict the class via clf.predict()

python
Copy
Edit
@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def predict():
    ...
You can start the web server with:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Then, visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser to access the interface.
